Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository (https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-transf-http/) as part of the TC's chartered work (the program of work and deliverables described in its [charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these repositories are distinct from [OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

This GitHub repository supports development of and change tracking for the OpenC2 HTTP Transfer Specification.

This repository is designed to support TC members' work on a formal specification that describes the use of HTTP as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages. The provisional work product title is "Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTP", edited by David Lemire (G2) and Duncan Sparrell (sFractal Consulting). The specification explains the transfer of OpenC2 command and response messages using HTTP. The authoritative format for the specification is Markdown. 

The new specification will be developed using the existing HTTPS Transfer Specification, v1.0, CS01, as a starting point. The intent is to apply lessons learned from the January 2020 Plug Fest / Hackathon in the development of the new specification.
